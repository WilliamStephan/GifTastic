## Specifications

* Create an array of strings with each element a component of a related topic.

* The app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

* Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

* Add a form to your page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your `topics` array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
